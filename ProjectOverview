Building an iPad app using Tauri with touch-based drag-and-drop interactions. We will focus on shipping simple functionality first and gradually expanding it with richer features. The idea is to start simple and ship incremental features that build toward the final app.

Stage 1: Setting Up and Shipping the Basics

Step 1: Project Setup

	•	Goal: Set up the basic Tauri app.
	•	Tools: Tauri, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Rust (optional for backend tasks).

	1.	Install Tauri:
	•	Follow the Tauri setup guide to create a new project.
	•	Ensure the Tauri project is properly set up and linked with a web-based frontend framework (like plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, or Vue).
	2.	Create Basic Checklist Template:
	•	Build a simple HTML form where users can add tasks to the checklist.
	•	Each task has a text input (e.g., “Pack my Toothbrush”) and a button to add the task.
	•	Display the checklist as a list using a basic UI framework (or custom CSS).

Step 2: Shipping a Basic Feature (Static Checklists)

	•	Goal: Ship a version of the app that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks (checklist).
	•	Tools: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the checklist logic.

	1.	Static Task List:
	•	Implement the checklist with basic “Add” and “Delete” functionality.
	•	Store tasks temporarily in the browser’s local storage to persist them across sessions.
	2.	Basic UI:
	•	Use a simple UI framework (or custom CSS) to create a clean, minimal design for the checklist.
	3.	Ship this feature: Push this basic checklist functionality as the first release. This will give you a usable app with a static checklist.

Stage 2: Implementing Emoji-based Checklists

Step 3: Custom Emoji Support

	•	Goal: Allow users to select emojis as bullet points for checklist items.
	•	Tools: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for emoji support, interact.js for future drag-and-drop.

	1.	Add Emoji Selector:
	•	Integrate an emoji picker (you can use libraries like emoji-picker-element).
	•	Allow users to select an emoji for each task (e.g., a toothbrush emoji for “Pack Toothbrush”).
	2.	Store Emojis in Local Storage:
	•	Store the selected emoji along with the task text in local storage so that it persists across sessions.
	3.	Update UI:
	•	Display the chosen emoji alongside each task instead of a regular bullet point.
	4.	Ship this feature: Once emoji support is working, push this update. Now users can personalize their checklists with custom emojis.

Stage 3: Touch-based Interactions and Drag-and-Drop

Step 4: Add Touch Support with interact.js

	•	Goal: Add touch-based drag-and-drop for checklist reordering using interact.js.
	•	Tools: JavaScript, interact.js for touch gestures and drag-and-drop.

	1.	Install and Set Up interact.js:
	•	Install interact.js to enable drag-and-drop and touch gestures.
	•	Set up basic draggable and droppable zones for each checklist item.
	2.	Implement Reordering via Drag-and-Drop:
	•	Allow users to reorder tasks by dragging them around.
	•	Handle dragstart, dragmove, and dragend events for reordering tasks on mobile touch devices.
	3.	Touch Events:
	•	Use touch events (touchstart, touchmove, and touchend) to support drag interactions on touchscreens.
	•	Make sure tasks update positions in local storage after dragging.
	4.	Ship this feature: Once drag-and-drop for reordering is working, ship this feature. Users can now reorder tasks via touch-based drag-and-drop.

Stage 4: Expanding with Gesture Features (Hammer.js)

Step 5: Add Additional Touch Gestures with Hammer.js

	•	Goal: Add richer touch gestures like swiping to complete or delete tasks.
	•	Tools: JavaScript, Hammer.js for gestures.

	1.	Install and Set Up Hammer.js:
	•	Install Hammer.js to enable multi-touch gestures like swiping, pinching, or tapping.
	•	Add gestures for specific actions, such as:
	•	Swipe left to mark a task as completed.
	•	Swipe right to delete a task.
	2.	Update UI for Gesture Feedback:
	•	Visually indicate when a task is marked as complete or deleted (e.g., fade-out or strike-through).
	3.	Refine Local Storage for Gestures:
	•	Update local storage to reflect the completion or deletion status of a task when gestures are used.
	4.	Ship this feature: Once gestures like swiping to delete or complete tasks are implemented, push this update. This adds richer touch-based interactions for users.

Stage 5: Advanced Features (Sync, Customization, etc.)

Step 6: Sync and Cloud Storage

	•	Goal: Expand with syncing functionality so users can access their checklists on different devices.
	•	Tools: Rust (for backend syncing), Cloud APIs (iCloud, Firebase, or custom backend with Rust).

	1.	Optional Sync with Cloud:
	•	Use a cloud storage solution (like Firebase or iCloud) to sync tasks across devices.
	•	Alternatively, use Rust for backend logic to handle syncing securely.
	2.	Ship this feature: Once syncing is enabled, ship the feature. This will allow users to access their checklists from different devices, including iPad, iPhone, or Mac.

Final Stage: Polish and Optimization

Step 7: Final Touches and Optimization

	•	Goal: Polish the UI/UX and optimize performance.
	•	Tools: UI frameworks (if necessary), performance optimization tools.

	1.	UI Enhancements:
	•	Add animations and smooth transitions for touch gestures (e.g., for drag-and-drop).
	•	Implement responsive design to ensure the app looks great on iPads in both portrait and landscape modes.
	2.	Performance Tuning:
	•	Optimize JavaScript and Tauri’s Rust backend for better performance.
	•	Minimize loading times and ensure smooth touch interactions.
	3.	Ship the final version: Once the app is polished and optimized, ship the final version with all core features and enhancements.

Summary of Feature Shipping Milestones:

	1.	Basic Checklist App (Static Tasks): Add and delete tasks.
	2.	Custom Emoji Support: Use emojis as bullet points for tasks.
	3.	Touch Drag-and-Drop with interact.js: Reorder tasks via touch interactions.
	4.	Advanced Gestures with Hammer.js: Swipe to complete or delete tasks.
	5.	Cloud Syncing (Optional): Sync checklists across devices.
	6.	Polishing and Final Release: Add final touches and ship the complete app.
